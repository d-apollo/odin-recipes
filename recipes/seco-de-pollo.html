<p><h2>Seco de Pollo, otherwise known as Chicken Stew, is an easy to make, yet warm and filling meal that can be found in every Ecuadorian household cookbook.
</h2> With this recipe, most of the cooking will be done by the chicken itself, stewing until it is tender. The main seasoning will be the dry rub, and then the rice and salad that will accompany it. </p>

<p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>

<ul>
<li>4 Chicken thighs About 2 pounds</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of paprika</li>
<li>1/2 teapoons of black pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of achiote/chili/cooking oil</li>
<li>1/2 of minced onion</li>
<li>1/2 of green bell pepper minced</li>
<li>4 cloves of garlic minced</li>
<li>1/4 cup of cilantro stem</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of Aji pepper seco</li>
<li>2 medium-sized tomatoes quartered.</li>
<li>1 bunch of cilantro and parsley</li>
<li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>1/2 cup of orange juice</li>
<li>1 big potato cut into chunks</li>
<li>Yellow achiote rice</li>
<li>Fried ripe plantains</li>
<li>Avocado slices</li>


</ul>

<p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>

<ol>

<li>Rub the chicken thighs with 2 tsp of salt, 2 tsp of paprika, 1.5 tsp of pepper and 1 tsp of cumin seed. Let it sit for 30 minutes. I don’t recommend chicken breast because I think chicken breast will become tough and fibery after long time stewing.</li>
<li>While waiting, let’s quickly make a vegetable mixture. Add 2 medium size tomatoes, 1/2 of a medium size onion, a bunch of parsley, a bunch of cilantro, 4 cloves of garlic in the blender. Pour in 2 cups of beer, 1/2 cup of orange juice.</li>
<li>Blend everything together until you get a smooth sauce or puree. Set it aside, we will use that later.
</li>
<li>Get a pot. Add about 3 tbsp of achiote oil. (I think it is achiote seeds simmered in vegetable oil so the oil is infused with that red color. I am not sure if this is special in Ecuador. If you can’t find this, I think you can try with chili oil. Because achiote has a sort of peppery aroma and It tastes a little bit earthy. Chili oil won’t be exactly the same but it should work fine. )</li>
<li>Now back to cooking. I am adding 4 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 of minced bell pepper, 1/2 of minced onion. Give them a few stir. Add some diced cilantro stem. You can also use cilantro leaves or parsley leaves here.
    Use medium heat; stir this until the onion becomes transparent.
    Push everything to the side so the chicken will directly touch the bottom. Add the chicken one by one. Let it fry for few minutes on medium heat. When you see the chicken gets that brown color. That is what we are looking for. Flip all the chicken over and fry the other side.</li>
<li>Cover it and bring this to a boil. Add 2 tsp of Aji seco powder and some salt. If you cannot find aji seco powder, you can try to mix some paprika with onion and rice powder. The color won’t be exactly the same but I have tried it, it tastes good too.
    Stir the pot and make sure the Aji seco powder is evenly dissolved. Give it a taste to see if it needs more salt. Mine does so I add a little more. Totally, I add about 2.5 tsp of salt here not including the salt that I rub the chicken with.
    Cover it and use the lowest heat to simmer it for 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Add some potato chunks and let it simmer for 20 minutes more or until the potato is cooked through. Add some diced cilantro and parsley. Mix it well and you are done.</li>
<li>Serve with yellow rice, fried plantains, and avocado. Spoon the sauce over the plate. You are ready to eat.</li>
