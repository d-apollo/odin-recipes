<p><h2>Empanadas are a truly hearty dish that represents the typical ecuadorian snack; heavy and fulfilling.
</h2> This recipe will call for your typical pastry and seasoning ingredients - but the real fun starts with the fillings, which will cover a variety of spices, lean ground beef, some Ecuadorian cheese, and the rest is up to you!</p>

<p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>

<ul>
<li>1 package of pre-made pie crust</li>
<li>1 pound of learn ground beef</li>

<li>With leftover pie crust, mix together and roll out and continue cutting circles, until all dough is used.</li>
<li>Lay a pie crust circle down. On prepared cookie sheet, add 2-3 tablesoons of filling to the middle of the circle. Top with 1 tablespoon a cheese.</li>

<li>Repeat steps 9 and 10 for all empanadas.</li>
<li>Arrange empanadas on cookie sheet.</li>
<li>Beat egg in a small bowl and brush on top of each empanada.</li>
<li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until tops are golden.</li>
